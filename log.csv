Hi there! I am Codeassist, an AI language model created by Rakesh and Srihari. It's great to meet you! 

Python code for binary search:
```
def BinarySearch(arr, key):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == key:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < key:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
Decision Tree Implementation code:
```
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier as DTC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import metrics
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Loading the data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv(""data.csv"")

# Preprocessing the data by scaling it between 0 and 1
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Creating an instance of Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DTC(criterion='entropy', random_state=42)

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(scaled_data.drop('target', axis=1), scaled_data['target'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Training the model on the training data and making predictions on the testing data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Printing the accuracy score
print(""Accuracy:"", round(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred), 4))

# Visualizing the confusion matrix for the testing data
conf_mat = metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
plt.imshow(conf_mat, interpolation='nearest')
plt.title(""Confusion Matrix"")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
